# Twitch-Bot

Language: C#
Framework: 4.5.2

DLL's used: RestSharp

This bot is still in the very early stages of development and is still a work progress. Proper documentation will come in the future, sorry for the inconvenience.

If you plan to compile this yourself, move the Quotes.txt, Variables.txt, Login.txt, and the Commands folder (containing the Permenant.txt and Normal.txt) into the Debug folder of your project.

To use this bot, you need 2 twitch accounts and a client-id from Twitch. One Twitch account acts as the BOT and the other is the HOST channel (the one to moderate). The auoth token for the HOST channel is required to have the "channel_editor" scope to use some of the wrappers.
